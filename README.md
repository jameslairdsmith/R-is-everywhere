# R is Everywhere
A repository cataloging the major organisations where R is being used or developed. Currently under construction.

A summary list of the these organisations can be found directly below, but for more detail on how R is used in these organisations you can consult the repository wiki. 

While R is the specific focus of the wiki, it also holds details of how these organisations may use other kinds of software that are competitiors or complements to R. It is often interesting to know where other kinds of software is relied upon. This is particualrly true in the case of data visualisation tools; while R has a set of packages that makes it excellent for creating graphics, there also exist other powerful tools such as d3.js.
