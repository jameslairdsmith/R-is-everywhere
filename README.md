# R is Everywhere
A repository cataloging the major organisations where R is being used or developed. Currently under construction.

A summary list of the these organisations can be found directly below, but for more detail on how R is used in these organisations you can consult the repository wiki. 

While R is the specific focus of the wiki, it also holds details of how these organisations may use other kinds of software that are competitiors or complements to R. It is often interesting to know where other kinds of software is relied upon. This is particualrly true in the case of data visualisation tools; while R has a set of packages that makes it excellent for creating graphics, there also exist other powerful tools such as d3.js.

## Contributing

Anybody can contribute to this repository! If you know of a major organisation using R that isn't already captured, feel free to add it here. The easiest way to do so is probably on the wiki tab where the pages are all editable.

## Sources

A number of sources have proved useful for finding out where R is used. They are:

* A organisation's own public statements or those of their senior people.
* Research output by the organisation.
* If the organisation has it's own Github repository.
* Job postings by organisations asking candidates to have experience in R

This list is by no means exhaustive. If have other sources, including your own experiences, feel free to use those.
